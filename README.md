![mmlpd banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46707320-f813-44d8-8683-02a2ee1c67cc)
## How to Use This Repo
Each folder contains .MD files for different projects relating to one of the many corresponding niches in this repository. This repo contains **1000+ projects across 11+ niches**, and is _constantly growing_. 

Created by consulting authoritative reviews, textbooks, and research articles to identify leading algorithms and frameworks in each niche. Each project idea leverages important technologies and may utilize popular open-source tools (e.g. OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, ROS) where relevant.

These guides are meant to be entirely self-contained - explainer videos, notes, and audios are embedded within the repository to ensure convenience.

Pick a project based on your interests and experience and start building!
