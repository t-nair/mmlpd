# Project Guides for Different AI Niches
![mmlpd banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/46707320-f813-44d8-8683-02a2ee1c67cc)
## How to Use This Repo
Each folder contains Markdown files for different projects relating to one of the many corresponding niches in this repository. This repo contains **1000+ projects across 11+ niches**, and is _constantly growing_. 

Project ideas were created by consulting authoritative reviews, textbooks, and research articles to identify leading algorithms and frameworks in each niche. Each idea leverages important technologies and may utilize popular open-source tools (e.g. OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, ROS) where relevant.

These guides are meant to be entirely self-contained - explainer videos, notes, and audios are embedded within the repository to ensure convenience.

Pick a project based on your interests and experience and start building!

## NOTE: This is a demo version!
It took hundreds of hours of in-depth research to fully build out the MMLPD. This demo version has 5 top projects in each niche fully explained (with embedded videos, readings, and other resources). Find out how to gain access to the full database here.
