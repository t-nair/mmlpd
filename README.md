## How to Use This Repo
Each folder contains .MD files for different projects relating to one of the 11 corresponding niches in this repository. 

Created by consulting authoritative reviews, textbooks, and research articles to identify leading algorithms and frameworks in each niche. Each project idea leverages important technologies and may utilize popular open-source tools (e.g. OpenCV, TensorFlow, PyTorch, ROS) where relevant.

These guides are meant to be entirely self-contained - explainer videos, notes, and audios are embedded within the repository to ensure convenience.

Pick a project based on your interests and experience and start building!
